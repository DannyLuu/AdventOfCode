##Solutions to the Advent of Code site

[Advent of Code Website][advent]

###Summary
_Advent of Code_ is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

Each program will contain it's own main function and the answers to the two parts of each Day.

###Purpose
I am mainly using this to brush up on my skills in programming. It will be coded within Java.
